# **Battle plan**

## Goal :

1. Become **full stack**
2. Perfect my level **of English**
3. find an internship targeting **technologies that interest me** (around languages ​​like JS, preferably)

## How? 'Or' What ?

1. work on technologies like **node.js** and **react**

2. work every day **my English** (this is not the main objective, but I think that regulated work may be a plus, whether it is to better understand the doc of technologies or for research internship / jobs).

3. Establishment of a **CV** and update of my **portfolio** aimed at making me attractive after an internship and / or future employer.

## Project:

- I currently have an idea for a **project**(application creation) I remember that during my interview with **BeCode** I was asked this question: _ "If you had a magic wand, what would you change, or would you add to **Facebook**" _.
  At the time, I could not provide an answer that I deemed satisfactory. But for some time now, I have had an idea

  - I would like to create an application based on **geolocation**
    The principle of the application would be as follows:

    - Propose an activity covered by a category (sport, board games, culture, walk, music, ...).
      it would create a point on a given place and allow users to see what other members of the community have proposed.

      **Ex** "I want to find a bassist for my rock band, I just have to post an ad on the application by informing the musicient I'm looking for, the place of rehearsals and a description. If a person search for a group via the application in my region, it can fill the search fields by category with "Music" and even our publication ".

      A rating system for each user would be implemented ranging from 1 to 5.
      1 being the person did not come and 5 wonderful meeting.

      The posts set up for more than 15 days will have to be reconfirmed by their creator in order to avoid posts "dead".

      A Chat system would be set up (in V2) to facilitate communication between members. In the meantime, an email will be sent.

    I am creating Wireframes in order to have an overall vision of the work to be done.
